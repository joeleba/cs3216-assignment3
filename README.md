# CS3216 Assignment 3: NexBus
_Submission date: 25 September 2015_

-- 

### Overview

NUS staff and students often want to know how long they will have to wait for the bus, or at least where the bus is. The screens at each bus stop displaying the estimated arrival time have been taken down, and the replacement NUS Next Bus app that the passengers have been asked to use is broken, and rarely ever works if at all. Nexbus provides a solution to this problem by allowing users to find out where their desired bus was last seen prior to their stop and at the current stop.
